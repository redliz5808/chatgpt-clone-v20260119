# ChatGPT Clone Test Project
This project follows some of the steps found in [Vibe Coding Bootcamp by Misbah Syed](https://www.packtpub.com/en-us/product/vibe-coding-bootcamp-9781806027996) on Packt.

## Technology Used / API Calls

### AI Application Builder
 - This application was initially built from text prompts using [v0 by Vercel](https://v0.app/).
 - The chat can be accessed via the following link:
    - [chatgpt-clone_v20260119](https://v0.app/chat/chat-gpt-clone-kk3wdVzNXZy?ref=0QXVPG)
 - It uses [ReactJS](https://react.dev/) with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### AI Chat API
 - This application uses the [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) API.
    - **Note:** At the time I'm committing this ReadMe file, I have not purchased a plan so chat generation may not be available.
